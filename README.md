# Harry-Potter-Database
I developed a Java Swing GUI to interface with a custom Harry Potter database I created. I designed the ER diagram, implemented the full relational schema, and created optimized SQL views to handle interactive queries. It was originally implemented for Oracle but was migrated to Postgres after graduation.
